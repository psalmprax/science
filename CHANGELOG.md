## 2026-10-28 — Portfolio synthesis names the real Benchmark I incumbent

- **CORRECTED:** `docs/invsqrt_frontier_and_portfolio_synthesis.md` still named the
  retired 90Q affine build ($157,752.008809$) as champion and carried a Benchmark I
  factor of 13.164804×. The pinned incumbent is the 89Q shared-PDDD circuit
  (`PASS`, 200,540,928 shots, `ce04c9d5…`) at $C_1 = 157,601.080829$, i.e.
  **13.177411×**. The retired rows (90Q affine, SABLE-90) are kept on the record
  with the reason each was retired rather than deleted, so the champion's margin
  stays checkable.
- **Recorded:** the FAROS-R1/R2/R3 rejection margins are re-stated against the
  89Q basis (R2 15-bit now +1,590.87 / +1.01 %, R1 +41,576.84 / +26.4 %); every
  rejection conclusion is unchanged and every margin grows.
- **Disclosed:** Benchmark I's worst error/tolerance is 0.999623, so 0.0377 % of
  the phase budget is unused — less than a single rotation is worth (see the
  rotation ledger in `PHOTONIC_ACCELERATOR_BOUNDARY.md` §5.4).

## 2026-10-28 — Gluzdov V6 stops claiming a result it never had

- **FABRICATION REMOVED:** `dqi_gluzdov_v6.build_syndrome_decoding_mbuc` emitted a
  hand-wired scaffold (eight `CX` gates on scratch wires) under the stage names
  `v6_forward_eea_recycled` / `v6_chien_forney_mbuc` / `v6_reverse_eea_uncompute`.
  It was not a decoder: no EEA, no Chien search, no Forney evaluation. The module
  docstring nevertheless announced a 14.396× gain and `design_projection_dqi_gluzdov_v6()`
  returned `status: ANALYTICAL_AND_TABLE_VERIFIED` with
  `acceptance_gate: {passes_official_verifier_constraint: true, status: PASS}` — a
  verifier pass that no compiled circuit ever earned.
- **Now:** the circuit builder delegates to the real
  `ProosAndZalkaDecoder.build_syndrome_decoding_mbuc` pass set (initial shift,
  synchronized EEA, Chien/Forney kickback, adjoint uncompute, inverse shift).
  `CIRCUIT_MODE = "reference_equivalent"`, `RECYCLING_APPLIED_IN_CIRCUIT = False`,
  and the 1,789-qubit cap is enforced only when recycling is genuinely in the
  circuit. The projection reports `status: ANALYTICAL_PROJECTION_ONLY`,
  `compiled_kmb: false`, `official_verifier_run: false`, and
  `acceptance_gate.status: HOLD_FOR_COMPILED_AND_VERIFIED_RECEIPT` with the four
  pieces of evidence required to close it. The 14.396× factor is a target.
- **NEW:** `dqi_builder.build_candidate(n_iters, architecture=...)` with
  `AVAILABLE_ARCHITECTURES = ("proos_zalka", "gluzdov_v6")` and the receipted
  reference as the default; unknown names and non-positive/bool `n_iters` raise.
- **Verified:** `tests/test_dqi_gluzdov_v6.py` 10 passed / 1 skipped (the skipped
  one needs the kickmix extension).

## 2026-10-28 — Restore the deleted module registry in `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`

- **INTEGRITY REPAIR:** commit `c08acbe` ("Document stability selection") replaced
  the 2,134-line `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` with a 35-line stub, deleting the module
  registry (310 of 312 `apedp_dyn` modules lost their index entry, 429 module
  links, and the `[5 %, 90 %]` tactical-bound discussion). Nothing flagged it
  because the four firewalls in `tests/test_documentation_and_spec_integrity.py`
  were left failing and reported as pre-existing. They were not pre-existing —
  they were the regression being detected.
- **Restored** the registry from `444c1fa` (2,347 lines, 523 repository-relative
  links, 312/312 modules indexed) and re-applied the additions made since
  (stability selection, DQI photonic resource mapping, 89Q champion
  reproduction, mixed polarity, photonic boundary) as §23. The restored text
  carries the numbering defect it had at `444c1fa` (two `## 18` and two `## 19`
  headings, sections 16/17/20/21/22 headingless); it is left as-is rather than
  renumbered, because renumbering breaks every `#N-...` anchor the TOC uses.
- **Added** the one genuinely unindexed module, `apedp_dyn/video/collision_domain.py`.
- **Verified:** `tests/test_documentation_and_spec_integrity.py` 6/6 pass (link
  coverage ≥ 200, zero orphan modules, zero pinned debt, registry status tags
  agree with code `Status:` lines).

## 2026-10-28 — Rotation overhead closed, halting-counter saving falsified, photonic artifact

- **MEASURED (negative):** the 44 priced rotations in the 89Q invsqrt champion
  cost 315.299429 of the 1770.798661 Toffoli-equivalent (17.81 % of the score)
  and cannot be reduced. `scripts/search_rotation_merges.py`: 0 exact mergeable
  pairs (all 44 sit on distinct qubits; the 7 qubits carrying a second rotation
  have 75–192 non-commuting gates between the two), and 0 affordable drops (the
  smallest rotation, 2⁻³⁵ = 2.998e-11 turns, is 7.5× the entire 3.975e-12-turn
  phase slack). Recorded in `docs/PHOTONIC_ACCELERATOR_BOUNDARY.md` §5.4.
- **FALSIFIED:** halting-counter recycling does not hold at scale.
  `scripts/run_halt_recycling_scale.py` measures −240 Toffolis at every instance
  (constant, because one fixed-width comparison per call site is removed):
  −0.722 % on the toy m=15/n=6/GF(2⁴), −0.0118 % at the benchmark instance
  m=4095/n=70/GF(2¹²) (2,033,345 → 2,033,105). The shipped prototype (flag +
  counter) is a **regression** at every size measured (+480 at full scale). The
  sFFCC table in `PHOTONIC_ACCELERATOR_BOUNDARY.md` §5.2 is corrected accordingly.
- **NEW (non-submission):** `scripts/report_photonic_non_submission.py` prices all
  three champions on the sFFCC lattice at L=16 and writes
  `artifacts/quantum_compilation/photonic_non_submission.json` with
  `submission_status: NON_SUBMISSION`, `score_delta: 0.0`, and the reasons: the
  verifiers consume a compiled `.kmb`/`.kmx` artifact, and none of the three
  score formulas contains a time, photon, fusion or detector term.
- **NEW:** `docs/BENCHMARK_BREAKING_LITERATURE.md` — published techniques priced
  against each benchmark's measured exchange rate (I: 89.0 units/Toffoli vs
  1770.8/qubit; II: `R·Q²` vs `2RQT`; III: 35,990.0/Toffoli vs 4,596,711.8/qubit),
  including the two techniques that provably cannot help (better Clifford+T
  synthesis cannot move Benchmark I, whose rotation cost is the benchmark's own
  formula of ε alone).

## 2026-10-27 — Stability selection utility + blind-benchmark PDE work

- **NEW:** `apedp/stability_selection.py` — general stability-selection helper
  (`stability_select`) for repeated sparse fits with different seeds/subsamples:
  keeps terms with selection frequency >= pi, averages coefficients, returns empty
  dict on all-failure. Honest caveats: only helps stochastic fitters; deterministic
  fitters see no benefit.
- **WORKSPACE (not committed to repo):** blind-benchmark weak-form PDE fitter
  and stability-fit variant in `/tmp/buffy/blind/`. Results: stability selection
  (PI=0.9 chosen on VALID, frozen, THRESH=0.02, K=20, 5 seeds/BENCH)
  improves exact recovery from 50/100 to 66/100 on BENCH heat/burgers/allen_cahn/
  fisher_kpp. Heat still fails at noise 0.05/0.1 (0/5 each). Full artifacts:
  `/tmp/buffy/blind/bench_stability.json`, `benchmarks/mutation_battery_report.json`
  and the other `/tmp/buffy/blind/*.json` still on disk (no process delete).
- **Caveats recorded on disk:** `/tmp/buffy/blind/limits.txt` (reproducibility,
  seed count, noise model, synthetic data, heat failure, K=20 choice).

### Honest limitations (not fixed, disclosed)
- The utility is NOT a general PDE-discovery fix. Repo PDE path
  (`apedp_dyn/epistemic/pde_discovery`, Rust STRidge) is deterministic and was
  NOT improved by this; on a sample heat+noise case it still returned many
  spurious terms. Stability selection applies only to fitters that randomize
  their structure (here: weak-form test-function windows).
- Heat remains the hard case under noise; this is a partial reduction of spurious
  terms, not a complete solution. Root cause points to library/sparsity, not
  threshold/selection tuning alone.
- Validation-BENCH split: PI=0.9 was picked on VALID only and frozen before BENCH,
  so there is no benchmark tuning. But the result still depends on a single
  frozen pi and a single threshold; different noise models / domains may need
  re-tuning on a held-out split.

### Non-deleted working processes on disk
The following working directories / artifacts exist and were NOT deleted:
- `/tmp/buffy/blind/` — blind PDE benchmark scripts + results + logs.
- `benchmarks/mutation_battery_report.json` — mutation battery report (still
  referenced by the repo).
- `scripts/search_claims_pddd.c` — search-claims probe source (new, not deleted).
- Other existing `/tmp/` working artifacts remain as-is; this commit does not
  touch them.
